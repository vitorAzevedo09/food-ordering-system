# Food Ordering System

Welcome to the Food Ordering System project! This project is a comprehensive example of building a modern microservices-based system for managing food orders. It leverages Spring Boot, clean and hexagonal architectures, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, SAGA pattern for data consistency, Outbox pattern for event-driven communication, Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), Apache Kafka for messaging, and Kubernetes (Google Kubernetes Engine) for orchestration.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Food Ordering System
- **Architecture and Technologies:** Spring Boot microservices, Clean & Hexagonal architectures, DDD, SAGA, Outbox, CQRS, Kafka, Kubernetes, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

## Project Structure

The Food Ordering System project is structured as a set of microservices, each serving a specific function within the application. Here is an overview of the project's structure:

- **Order Service:** Handles order creation, order status, and communication with other services.
- **Payment Service:** Manages payment processing and interactions with payment gateways.
- **Menu Service:** Provides menu items and pricing information.
- **User Service:** Manages user authentication and profiles.
- **Notification Service:** Sends notifications to users.
- **Shipping Service:** Manages order delivery and logistics.

## Features

The Food Ordering System project showcases various features and best practices:

- Clean & Hexagonal Architectures: Each microservice is designed using clean and hexagonal architecture, promoting modularity and maintainability.

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD): We implement DDD principles, defining clear domain models for orders, payments, menus, users, notifications, and shipping.

- SAGA Pattern: To ensure data consistency across microservices, we implement the SAGA pattern for managing distributed transactions.

- Outbox Pattern: We use the Outbox pattern for efficient event-driven communication, ensuring that events are reliably delivered.

- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): The application segregates commands and queries for optimal performance and scalability.

- Apache Kafka: Kafka is employed for event-driven communication and message streaming between microservices.

- Kubernetes & GKE: The project is orchestrated and deployed using Kubernetes and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for scalability and container management.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Food Ordering System, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Docker (for running containers)
- A Kubernetes cluster or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for deployment
- Apache Kafka (for messaging)
- [Other specific dependencies]
